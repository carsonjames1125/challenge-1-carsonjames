# Challenge #1 - Carson James

## Description

The purpose of this project was to take the colde of an existing application from a company and refractor the code to make it more modern and accessible for users across the internet. What i learned doing this project, consisted of ways to properly structure html documents and how to limit CSS coding by consolidating the html document. One other thing that i learned that was very useful was just more commands and properties and playing around with them and really getting a chance to refine an application. 

## Installation

Once the main protion of the project was done we needed to add the files to a working URL. Whilst adding, tracking, and commiting changes throughout the duration of the project, the last commit would be the final repository that we use. To install the project, you must go to the repository on GitHub after the final "git push" and go to the settings tab of the "repo." In that tab you scroll to the GitHub pages section, make sure everything is on the main branch, and push the website live. GitHub also provides you with a URL as well to spread to others to view the webpage. 

## Usage

In the 3 Screenshots listed below, this is the newly updated webpage with Semantic HTML and updated CSS styling. As you can see, the styling matches the original and the placement and functionality of the webpage works.
